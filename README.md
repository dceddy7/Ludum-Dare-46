# Ludum-Dare-46
My entry for the Ludum Dare 2020 game jam

This is just a repository for the C# code in the game.
The full, playable version can be found at https://dceddy7.itch.io/ludemfire-game

The theme of the project was "Keep it alive"
To meet the theme I came up with a game in which the player needs to fuel a fire.

This project allowed me to play with several features in Unity that I wanted more experience with.
Among these were:
-2D particle effects
-2D player movement scripts
-Object interaction and physics
-Producing HTML5 an build of a Unity game
